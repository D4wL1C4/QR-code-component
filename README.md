## My process

first I made the whole skeleton, in html with the different "div" boxes. After I took care of the css, starting with the integrality and continuing little by little until the last details.

### Built with

- visual studio code
- youtube
- my eyes

### What I learned

I've learn to do a lot of things while making this challenge. For example I've learn to center objects, align items or using hsl color system. And i understood the function of "div"

```css
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
    text-align: center;
```
```css
background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
```

### Continued development

I want to focus on the responsive method. Because i don't know yet how to use this
